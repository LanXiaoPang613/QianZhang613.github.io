I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering, School of Information Technology, [Jiangsu Open University](https://sit.jsou.edu.cn/2023/0904/c6266a159158/page.psp). I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the School of Optical-Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology in 2021, supervised by Prof. Qiu Chen, Prof. Feifei Lee and Prof. Yagang Wang. Prior to that, I received my B.E. in Automation from Changzhou Institute of Technology In in 2016.

<br />My research interest falls in the scope of **Noisy Label Learning (NLL), Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, which enhance deep neural networks robustness against data corruption [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1749-8653). NLL is a significant area of research in machine learning and artificial intelligence. It focuses on developing methods to train models effectively when the training data contains incorrect or mislabeled instances, which is common in real-world datasets. Noisy labels can arise from various sources, such as human error during data annotation, automated labeling systems, or inherent ambiguities in the data. The ultimate goal of NLL is to ensure that models can reliably extract meaningful patterns and make accurate predictions, even in the presence of imperfect data. **My future research interests include NLL in medical imaging, AI for science, such as AI for Energy, AI for Communication, etc**. <br />
